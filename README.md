# gps-spoofing-and-ai-detection
This is a Bachelor Thesis researching how an ML algorithm can detect GPS Spoofing attempts, this will be done with IoT Pycom devices recieving GPS signals and communicating it to a different Pycom that will run the ML and try to detect spoofing attempts.

## Pycom Development Environment

This Guide will help you setup your development environment for working with Pycom devices (LoPy4, FiPy etc.).
